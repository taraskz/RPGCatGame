### May 29th

### May 30th
- Taras : Made a description of all the locations on the map in an array, added the header.
### May 31st
- Taras: Created arrays for direction options and assigned values for room location and current location. Made a function that takes input of the user and updates the x and y values to move him around the map, tested it by making simple input statement in menu and it works.
### May 3rd
- Taras: Made a sub menu for movement to better handle the user input and called it in main menu. Also created the intro, might make a intro menu so that there is some kind of a reward at the start just like in my text based game.
