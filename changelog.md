### May 29th
- Taras : Finished the creation and printing of our map and can call it in the main game.
### May 30th
- Taras : Made a description of all the locations on the map in an array, added the header.
### May 31st
- Taras: Created arrays for direction options and assigned values for room location and current location. Made a function that takes input of the user and updates the x and y values to move him around the map, tested it by making simple input statement in menu and it works.
### April 3rd
- Taras: Made a sub menu for movement to better handle the user input and called it in main menu. Also created the intro, might make a intro menu so that there is some kind of a reward at the start just like in my text based game.
### April 4th
- Taras: Made a simple player class that has health and name of player, maybe will add something like an ability but probably wont fit into this game. Improved the menu by adding an option feature to print of the options to the user and choose and action between map and move so far. Made a simple inventory class but will have to fix it up as I think there is two functions that do the same thing.
