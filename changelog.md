# Changelog

### May 30th
- Taras : Made a description of all the locations on the map in an array, added the header.
### May 31st
- Taras: Created arrays for direction options and assigned values for room location and current location. Made a function that takes input of the user and updates the x and y values to move him around the map, tested it by making simple input statement in menu and it works.
### June 3rd
- Taras: Made a sub menu for movement to better handle the user input and called it in main menu. Also created the intro, might make a intro menu so that there is some kind of a reward at the start just like in my text based game.
### June 4th
- Taras: Made a simple player class that has health and name of player, maybe will add something like an ability but probably wont fit into this game. Improved the menu by adding an option feature to print of the options to the user and choose and action between map and move so far. Made a simple inventory class but will have to fix it up as I think there is two functions that do the same thing.
### June 5th
- Taras: created a skippable introduction by making a intro() function then will make a intro thing where the user gets to pick a starting cat to fight with at the begginging of the game. Need to make a class for that. Created a class for cats which acts as weapons in this game and incorporated it into the intro for now. Need to figure out how to put them into a shop feature when we get there.
- Trey: Edited some of the code, created classes for enemies and came up with the idea of having to kill the dog miniboss and getting the bone key in order to challenge clawmancer felisar.
### June 6th
